    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>2020-2021 <br><a href="https://www.bertagni1882.it/">Bertagni Spa</a></li>
        <p>In my prior role at the Italian pasta production company, my specific objective was the meticulous preparation and cooking of various sauces, including cheese, tomato, and spinach. <br />
            Each type of sauce underwent a programmed cooking phase, where specified ingredients were combined in large boilers. <br />
            This process adhered to a predetermined cooking time, during which the ingredients melded into the desired consistency, maintaining a minimum temperature of 75 degrees Celsius.
           Upon completion of the cooking process, the fully prepared sauce was carefully offloaded into individual 10kg bags. Before entering the refrigeration phase, a crucial step involved immersing these sealed bags in a water tub. <br />
           This immersion facilitated a rapid reduction in temperature, ensuring the sauces reached the required 5 degrees Celsius before being transferred to refrigerated storage. <br />
           It's noteworthy that these meticulously crafted sauces played a pivotal role as stuffed ingredients in other products, such as tortellini. The quality and flavor of the sauces were integral to enhancing the overall taste and appeal of the final pasta products. <br />
           My role demanded precision not only in adhering to programmed cooking parameters and cooling procedures but also in contributing to the excellence of the end products that incorporated these sauces. <br />
        </p>
        <li>2021-2023 <br><a href="https://uk.dabpumps.com/dabpumps">Dab Pumps Spa</a></li>
        <p> 
            During my tenure at DAB, a pivotal player in water technology for over 40 years, I actively contributed to the development of cutting-edge solutions. <br />
            Specifically, my role involved the construction of a stainless steel submersible pump with a microcasted steel vortex impeller. <br />
            This pump, designed with precision, is tailored for efficiently managing residential wastewater, including sewage containing solid matter up to 50 mm in size. <br />
            My responsibilities spanned various phases of the pump's assembly, encompassing the integration of the pump engine, battery, and all interior components. <br />
            This comprehensive approach ensured the seamless functionality and reliability of the sewage pump. <br />
            Before final deployment, the meticulously crafted pump underwent rigorous testing to verify its correct operation. <br />
            This crucial step in the production process guaranteed that the pump met the high standards set by DAB, aligning with the company's commitment to reliability, efficiency, and innovative solutions. <br />
